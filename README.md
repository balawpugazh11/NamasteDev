# 🚀 Namaste DSA: Daily Coding Journey

A professional repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently following the **Namaste DSA** curriculum, pushing code **every single day** to build consistency and deep technical intuition.

## 📌 Repository Goal
The aim is to transition from a MERN Stack Developer to a highly efficient problem solver. By committing daily, I am documenting my progress in:
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Analyzing problems beyond the first solution.
* **Optimization:** Writing code with optimal Time ($O$) and Space ($S$) complexity.
* **Consistency:** Maintaining a "Green Square" streak on GitHub to prove daily dedication.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Environment:** Node.js
- **Focus:** Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Optimization

## 📂 How this Repo is Structured
To keep things organized without constant README updates, the code is structured by topic:
- `Arrays/` - Sorting, Searching, and Slidewindow problems.
- `Recursion/` - Basic to Advanced Backtracking.
- `LinkedList/` - Singly, Doubly, and Circular logic.
- `Complexity-Analysis/` - Notes on Big O notation.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a **Full Stack Developer** specializing in the **MERN Stack**. I believe that great web applications are built on a foundation of solid algorithms.

* **Currently Learning:** Namaste DSA by Akshay Saini.
* **Location:** Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu.
* **Objective:** Building scalable software and solving complex logic.
