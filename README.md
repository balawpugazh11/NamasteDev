# 💻 Namaste DSA | My Daily Grind

This is where I track my daily progress as I dive deep into Data Structures and Algorithms through the **Namaste DSA** curriculum. 

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** who loves building with the **MERN stack**, but I realized that to build truly scalable apps, I need to master the logic behind the code. So, I’m pushing code here **every single day**—no excuses.

### 🎯 The Goal
I'm not just solving problems; I'm training my brain to think in terms of **Time and Space Complexity**. My aim is to go from "just making it work" to "making it efficient."

### 🛠 My Toolkit
* **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)
* **Concepts:** Big O, Recursion, Arrays, Linked Lists, and eventually DP.
* **Source:** Namaste DSA (Akshay Saini)

### 📈 Why there's no "Progress Table" here?
I'd rather spend my time coding than updating a README file every hour. 
* **Check my Commit History:** You’ll see exactly what I worked on today, yesterday, and the day before.
* **Check my GitHub Graph:** The green squares tell the story of my consistency better than a list ever could.

### 📂 Structure
I keep it simple:
- Each folder is named after the topic (e.g., `Recursion`, `Arrays`).
- Inside, you'll find my solution and a few lines on my thought process.

### 👨‍💻 A bit about me
I'm , currently focusing on becoming a solid **Full Stack Engineer**. When I'm not grinding DSA, I'm usually building MERN apps or refining my CSS.

**Let's connect!** If you're also on the DSA grind, feel free to star this repo and follow along. 🚀
